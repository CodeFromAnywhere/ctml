# Design Goals:

- Supercharge raw html, md, and data-files as much as possible. No fancy languages needed.
- Should be incrementally adoptable into an existing react-website on a per-page basis.
- Minimise source token size
- LoB: Locality of Behavior for increased comprehension (Read more [here](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) and [here](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf))
- Build an AI friendly internet
- Having fun building a personal website in a language no-one knows

# Limitations:

- Does not have much space for conditional logic.
- Everything you want to do with javascript needs to be done in raw javascript. I don't know the best way to do this. If you work with raw js, you don't have typesafety, for example. Imports aren't easy to get either.
