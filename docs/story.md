When I was 10 years old and learned html, I always wondered why I couldn't create my own elements, or add properties.

Much later I learned React and saw that Facebook made it possible. But at what cost? JS Fatigue. JS solves all problems, but it comes at a cost: complexity.

That's why I wanted to give this a go: a more intuitive simplistic way to write full-stack apps.

I don't know if it will work, but the idea is simple: avoid javascript at all cost, write as much as possible in component-driven html, markdown, and datafiles like csv and json.

Design Goals:

- Minimise source token size
- LoB: Locality of Behavior for increased comprehension (Read more [here](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) and [here](https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/PatternsOfSoftware.pdf))
- Build an AI friendly internet
- Having fun building a personal website in a language no-one knows

wow
