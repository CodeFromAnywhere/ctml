# Migrating to CTML

ctml is designed to be as incrementally adoptible as possible without increasing the complexity too much.

Right now I'm still in the PoC phase (and may never get past that) but I aim to make it super easy to incrementally adopt ctml.

Ideas:

- Write good guides on how to do all kinds of things in bare html/css/js
- Make it possible to use `ctml` components inside of react (which should be simple html)
- Make it possible to use entry-points of react inside of ctml
- Make it possible to run ctml and your react ssr project from the same server, side-by-side.
