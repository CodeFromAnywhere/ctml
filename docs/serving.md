If you want to serve your ctml code, it needs to be parsed to html first. For this, the parser is used. It traverses your code recursively from your `index.htm` file down to the last element.

Once it's done you'll end up with your html files in the same directory because it is saved as `.html` while your ctml code must be saved as `.htm`.
