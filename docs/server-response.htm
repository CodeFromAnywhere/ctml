<!-- 
The idea of this JSON container is, if it's not available, it shouldn't show up

Not sure though where to get this data from :/ maybe some sort of special compo that gets it from the post response rather than a file?
-->
<server-response>
    <!-- doing continional styling here is certainly a limitation to this framework -->
    <div>${message}</div>
</server-response>
