# Hello world

How are you doing. This is ctml. ctml stands for component-driven html and aims to simplify boilerplate and dx for edge websites.

I used Bun's HTMLRewriter along with Bun.serve to create a JIT parser for HTML files that act as components like in React.

The idea is that you can serve this at the edge, it's super simple to wrap your head around, and you can split up your html into little components, which makes it easier to work with. It avoids using shadow dom and other heavy artillery like in React. You're working in actual Markdown, HTML, CSS and JS files.

_Here you can see an overview:_
