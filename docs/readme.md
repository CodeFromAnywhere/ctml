# Hello world

How are you doing. This is ctml. ctml stands for component-driven html and aims to simplify boilerplate and dx for edge websites.

I don't know yet exactly where I want to go with this. ctml could be component driven html with as little boilerplate as possible.

Something like mdx but i don't want to need a server. It should build to html quickly, but I want to be in control of how it looks.

What if it would support md, js, ts, json, csv, xml, all out of the box? That would be pretty cool.

## Next time..

I've done this in a long night plus most of the subsequent day. It is still a hobby project though. Next time I should fix the weird server error that prevents me from making everything realtime.

Another key thing would be to make the parser more performant. For some reason, it's not as performant as I'd want.

Last but not least,

- deployment
- connecting this to a website + github
- executing server-side js/ts code for a post request, and getting a server-response back
- frontmatter in markdown as variables for the wrapper?
