# Hello world

How are you doing. This is ctml. ctml stands for component-driven html and aims to simplify boilerplate and dx for edge websites.

I don't know yet exactly where I want to go with this. ctml could be component driven html with as little boilerplate as possible.

Something like mdx but i don't want to need a server. It should build to html quickly, but I want to be in control of how it looks.

What if it would support md, js, ts, json, csv, xml, all out of the box? That would be pretty cool.
