I'm not sure yet how to handle state and how to persist it, but I think it'd be cool to do this in the very same json source files, on the edge.

Non-persistent state can of course be done with simple js scripts, but maybe I'll come up with a better, react-like syntax, if I feel the need.

But it must be very simple!
